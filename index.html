                    <h2 class="title">History</h2>
                    <p class="post_description">Real Madrid have once again defined an era in world football, winning
                        four European Cups and four
                        Club World Cup. In 2014, they lifted La Décima, before winning the Club World Cup that same
                        year.
                        Zidane's first two seasons in the dugout were historic, clinching La Undécima and La Duodécima.
                        What's more, 2017 became a record-breaking year when the team got their hands on five trophies:
                        The European Cup, the Club World Cup, LaLiga and the European and Spanish Super Cups.
                        La Decimotercera then came in 2018, when they came out on top against Liverpool in Kiev.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the first few years of this new decade three trophies were added to the cabinet by José
                        Mourinho's Real Madrid. The most notable was the 2011-12 Liga title, which they won with a
                        record-breaking 100 points, the highest score achieved in the history of the championship at
                        that
                        stage, and 121 goals. They also beat Barcelona to clinch a Copa del Rey and a Supercopa de
                        España.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti arrived at Real Madrid. The Italian won four trophies with the
                        Whites,
                        the first coming in the shape of Real Madrid's nineteenth Copa del Rey, after beating Barcelona
                        1-2
                        in the final. On 24 May 2014, Madrid lifted the European Cup once again, claiming La Décima with
                        a
                        4-1 victory over Atlético in Lisbon. Goals from Ramos, Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano secured the
                        triumph.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Two further triumphs arrived in the second season under Ancelotti: The European Super Cup,
                        against
                        Sevilla and Real Madrid’s first World Club Cup, against San Lorenzo. This meant Real Madrid
                        capped
                        of a historic year in their history in 2014, making it the year in which most trophies were won
                        by
                        the club. In June 2015, Rafa Benítez returned to the club where he cut his teeth, to take charge
                        of the Whites. Then, in January 2016, Zidane made the step up to first team coach, following his
                        legendary career as a player. His first season ended with the team lifting the La Undécima
                        trophy,
                        against Atlético in Milán.

                <h2 class="title">Real Madrid has won every game played since February 4.</h2>
                <p class="post_description">
                    In one of the most demanding periods of the season and diminished by casualties, Real Madrid has
                    taken a step forward to their best winning streak of the season. After the victory against
                    Casademont Zaragoza on Sunday, the Whites have now won 12 consecutive games from February 4.
                    In just over a month, they have won the Copa del Rey and qualified for the Euroleague playoffs.

                    The 8 consecutive wins from the start of the season and the similar run in December have been
                    surpassed.
                    Laso's team began their triumphant journey against Baskonia in the second match in February. Since
                    then,
                    they won seven more games in a near-perfect month, in which they lifted their 28th Copa del Rey and
                    sealed
                    their place in the Euroleague playoffs with eight rounds remaining after beating Panathinaikos.

                    March, full of victories
                    This month has started off impeccably, with four wins in seven days. On their return to the Martin
                    Carpena,
                    the repeat of the cup final, the behind closed-door match in Milan and the victories against Asvel
                    and
                    Casademont Zaragoza are the highlights of March, with 7 matches left to play, including the League
                    Clasico
                    next Sunday 22 at the WiZink Center. In addition, Real Madrid hopes to secure home-court advantage
                    in the
                    Euroleague playoffs.
